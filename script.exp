In order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current\r
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MySQL, and\r
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,\r
so you should just press enter here.\r
\r
Enter current password for root (enter for none): "
send -- "\r"
expect -exact "\r
OK, successfully used password, moving on...\r
\r
Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MySQL\r
root user without the proper authorisation.\r

By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone\r
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for\r
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation\r
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a\r
production environment.\r
\r
Remove anonymous users? \[Y/n\] "
send -- "y\r"
expect -exact "y\r
 ... Success!\r
\r
Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This\r
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.\r
\r
Disallow root login remotely? \[Y/n\] "
send -- "n\r"
expect -exact "n\r
 ... skipping.\r
\r
By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can\r
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed\r
before moving into a production environment.\r
\r
Remove test database and access to it? \[Y/n\] "
send -- "y\r"
expect -exact "y\r
 - Dropping test database...\r

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far\r
will take effect immediately.\r
